# Current Projects 
## Self projects
### Thanopod
 * A two-wheeled balancing robot that can move around in its environment 
 * Chose this project as there is lots of learning involved from a variety of fields like control theory (PID), electronics, programming etc
 * Implemented the idea using Raspberry Pi, stepper motors, IMU, PID control and Kalman Filter
 * Planning to integrate active PID control, computer vision and path planning
 * Inspired by the robot Handle by Boston dynamics and the videos made by the youtuber 74Samy

### High-powered RC car

## Competitions
### Line following and maze solving bot (Meshmerize, Techfest IITB)
* A line following bot which uses infrared sensors to detect a line and follow it
* Uses PID control to follow the line 
* Uses a Raspberry Pi Pico to make decisions for turning at junctions and to remember the maze and to minimize the path


### Remote controlled gripper robot (Cosmoclench, Techfest IITB)

### RC boat (Rowboatics, Techfest IITB)
